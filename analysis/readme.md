![google-deepmind-4nBaO2Y4IzQ-unsplash](https://github.com/chanronnie/Olympics/assets/121308347/d3562af4-c1ed-424b-a526-254efb917446)

<br>

 I am conducting an exploratory data analysis on Olympic athletes from 1896 to 2022 using **PostgreSQL** and the datasets I created during my web scraping project (located in the [data folder](https://github.com/chanronnie/Olympics/tree/main/data)). Note that the obtained outputs will include data up to September 2023


My objective in conducting a data analysis is to **verify the accuracy of the data I previously gathered through web scraping**. By comparing my collected data with the information available on [Olympedia website](https://www.olympedia.org), I aim to ensure the reliability and consistency of the datasets I have created.

## About Data
The datasets that I am going to use are the datasets that I created using the data that I scraped from the [Olympedia website](https://www.olympedia.org).\

## Entity Relationship Diagram
I used the [DB Diagram tool](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to create the following ERD.\
Note that I renamed the `athletes` dataset to `olympic_history` for my analysis.

Here is the code that I used for creating the ERD for the `Olympics` datasets on DB Diagram tool.

```markdown
TABLE olympic_history
{
	id INTEGER
	name VARCHAR
	gender VARCHAR
	born VARCHAR
	died VARCHAR
	height VARCHAR
	weight VARCHAR
	team VARCHAR
	game VARCHAR
	noc VARCHAR
	sport VARCHAR
	event VARCHAR
	medal VARCHAR
}

TABLE athletes_roles
{
	id INTEGER
	name VARCHAR
	roles VARCHAR
}

TABLE host_cities
{
	year INTEGER
	season VARCHAR
	game VARCHAR
	host_city VARCHAR
}

TABLE noc_countries
{
	noc VARCHAR
	country VARCHAR
}

// Establish relationships between datasets
REF: olympic_history.id > athletes_roles.id
REF: olympic_history.game > host_cities.game
REF: olympic_history.noc > noc_countries.noc
```
